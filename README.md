## Exercise 1: Create a small web page about yourself and / or your hobby
* Create a small website about yourself and/or your hobby.
* Make sure to use som different headline levels (h1 - h3)
* Choose some nice Google Fonts.
* Include som lists (unordered/bullet list and ordered/number list)
* Include som nice images.
* Write some text (or go with Lorem Ipsum placeholder text that you insert using emmet abbrevitions)
* Create a top-level menu that let the user navigate between the pages on your site.

## Exercise 2: Improve the styling of your web site
* Keep working on the site you created during exercise 1.
* Now you are going to improve the styling (and accessibility apsects of it as well):
* Add a footer. Put a copyright notice and an address inside the footer. Use the address-tag for the address. Make the address be on the same line as the copyright notice by styling it.
* Make sure that the footer is displayed at the bottom of the page even for pages with short content (if you don’t have such a page create it and add it to the menu). Use the Sticky footer-fix.
* Change your navigational menu so that it is a unordered list (but no bullets should be displayed) - but so that it still looks the same as before.
* Add a background image and a semi-transparent background color and some padding to your main element.
* Add the CSS-box-sizing fix so that padding and border are counted as part of the width you set for elements (mostly the main element).
* Add some images that have text floating around them (that is: add float to the images).
* Make the header fixed (and adjust the margin of the main section accordingly) - so that it doesn’t scroll with the page content.
